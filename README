IO-EditPrompt version 0.01

Sometimes you need to prompt a user for a large amount of text. (Say
more than one line.)

This module provides extended functionality for entering or changing text for
command line programs.

The IO::Prompter module does a wonderful job of encapsulating a lot of user
entry tasks in a really nice interface. One thing it does not do well is allow
input for long-form text. Many version control systems use the approach of
opening a window in your editor to deal with long-form text. This seems like a
great solution and avoids a large number of nasty bits (like editing functions
surrounding Unicode characters).

This module wraps up the functionality needed to use an editor in this fashion
in a relatively straight-forward interface.

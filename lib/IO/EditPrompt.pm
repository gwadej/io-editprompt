=head1 NAME

IO::EditPrompt - Support a prompt that uses the configured editor to take long text

=head1 VERSION

This document describes IO::EditPrompt version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use IO::EditPrompt;

    my $p = IO::EditPrompt->new();
    my $answer = $p->prompt( 'Explain in your own words:' );

    my $p1 = IO::EditPrompt->new({ tmpdir=>'./tmp', editor=>'emacs' });
    my $abstract = $p1->prompt( "Enter your abstract:\n(no HTML tags allowed)\n", 'Boilerplate abstract' );
    my $write_up = $p1->prompt( <<EOH );
    Enter a write-up of meeting:
      blank lines for paragraphs.
      <em/>, <strong/>, <a/> are all supported
    EOH

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides extended functionality for entering or changing text for
command line programs.

The C<IO::Prompter> module does a wonderful job of encapsulating
a lot of user entry tasks in a really nice interface. One thing it does not do well
is allow input for long-form text. Many version control systems use the approach
of opening a window in your editor to deal with long-form text. This seems like a
great solution and avoids a large number of nasty bits (like editing functions
surrounding Unicode characters).

This module wraps up the functionality needed to use an editor in this fashion in
a realtively straight-forward interface.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 new

Create new C<IO::EditPrompt> object. This object can be used with multiple prompt
calls. The optional paramters must be passed as a hashref.

=over

=item dir

Specify a directory for the temporary file to edit.

=item default_editor

The name of a default editor if none is provided by the EDITOR environment
variable.

=item editor

Force calling this program as the editor, independent of the environment. If
this parameter is missing, the program will default to using the EDITOR environment
variable. If there is no value for EDITOR, we try the supplied C<default_editor>
parameter. If none of these have values, we default to C<vim>.

=back

=head2 prompt( $prompt, $deftext )

Open the editor with the supplied C<$prompt> and C<$deftext> already filled in.
Every line of the prompt text will be prefixed by the string C<# >, the default
text will be supplied as is. After the user saves any changes, the content of
the file is read and any text that begins with C<#> is removed. The result is
returned to the caller.

If the cleaned up text is empty, the user is given an attempt to retry.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

IO::EditPrompt relies on the EDITOR environment variable to supply a default
editor to use.
